## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview

The Web Shop project aims to create a fully functional e-commerce website where users can browse products, add them to their cart, and make purchases. This project will be developed by two interns, one focusing on frontend development using React, and the other on backend development using Java with the Spring Framework.

### 1.2 Purpose of Documentation

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for the interns working on this project. It outlines the key concepts and tasks they should cover during their development work, ensuring that the final product is well-structured, secure, and meets the requirements of a typical web shop application.

### 1.3 Audience

This documentation is intended for the two interns who will be working on the project. It will help them understand their roles and responsibilities, as well as provide guidance on implementing various aspects of the web shop application.

## 2. Frontend Development (React)

### 2.1 Project Setup

- Set up a new React project using Create React App or an equivalent tool.
- Organize the project structure for scalability and maintainability.

### 2.2 User Interface Design

- Create responsive and user-friendly UI components for product listing, cart, checkout, and user account management.
- Implement a consistent and visually appealing design.

### 2.3 State Management

- Use state management libraries like Redux or Context API for managing application state.
- Ensure efficient data flow between components.

### 2.4 Data Fetching and API Integration

- Fetch product data from the backend API.
- Implement user authentication and authorization flows.

### 2.5 Routing and Navigation

- Set up routing using React Router or a similar library.
- Implement navigation between different sections of the web shop.

### 2.6 Component Structure

- Organize components into a logical hierarchy.
- Create reusable components for common UI elements.

### 2.7 Error Handling

- Implement error handling for network requests and user interactions.
- Display informative error messages to users.

### 2.8 Testing

- Write unit tests for components and integration tests for user flows.
- Ensure code coverage and reliability.

### 2.9 Deployment

- Deploy the React frontend to a hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
- Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines if possible.

## 3. Backend Development (Java with Spring Framework)

### 3.1 Project Setup

- Create a new Spring Boot project.
- Configure the project for Java development.

### 3.2 CRUD Operations

- Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for products and user data.

### 3.3 JWT Authentication and Authorization

- Implement JWT-based authentication and authorization for users.
- Secure API endpoints to prevent unauthorized access.

### 3.4 Password Hashing

- Hash user passwords securely before storing them in the database.
- Implement password validation and reset functionality.

### 3.5 Logging

- Configure logging using a logging framework like Log4j or SLF4J.
- Log relevant information for debugging and monitoring.

### 3.6 Database Connection (PostgreSQL)

- Set up a connection to a PostgreSQL database.
- Define database schemas and tables for products and user data.

### 3.7 SQL Migrations Support

- Use a database migration tool (e.g., Flyway) to manage database schema changes.
- Ensure smooth database updates and version control.

### 3.8 Custom Exceptions

- Create custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios.
- Implement global exception handling for consistent error responses.

### 3.9 Repository Pattern

- Implement the repository pattern to interact with the database.
- Separate data access code from business logic.

### 3.10 HTTP Response Entities

- Define consistent HTTP response entities for success and error responses.
- Use appropriate status codes and error messages.

## 4. Conclusion

### 4.1 Summary

This software documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Web Shop project, detailing the responsibilities of the two interns working on the frontend and backend development. By following the guidelines and concepts outlined in this document, the interns can create a secure, scalable, and fully functional e-commerce website.

### 4.2 Future Enhancements

In the future, additional features and improvements can be made to enhance the web shop, such as implementing payment processing, user reviews, product recommendations, and more. Regular maintenance and updates should also be considered to ensure the continued success of the application.
